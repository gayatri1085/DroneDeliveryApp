This is a web-based drone delivery system that allows users to input pickup and drop-off locations, track the drone's movement on a map, and monitor the delivery process in real time. 
The system is designed to work with a solar-powered drone base station and can be used for various applications such as food delivery, medical supply transport, 
and emergency services.
