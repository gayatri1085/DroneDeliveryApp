This is a web-based drone delivery system that allows users to input pickup and drop-off locations, track the drone's movement on a map, and monitor the delivery process in real time. 
The system is designed to work with a solar-powered drone base station and can be used for various applications such as food delivery, medical supply transport, 
and emergency services.

In this drone delivery system, the Actor-Critic algorithm can be used to optimize drone navigation and decision-making: -

State Representation: The drone's current location, battery level, and obstacles act as the state.
Actor (Decision Maker): Selects the best action (e.g., move forward, turn, adjust altitude) based on a learned policy.
Critic (Evaluator): Evaluates the reward for the chosen action, considering factors like shortest route, battery efficiency, and avoiding restricted areas.
Learning Process: The critic calculates the TD error (difference between expected and actual reward), updating both the actor's policy and the critic's value function.
Continuous Improvement: Over time, the drone learns to navigate more efficiently, reducing delivery time and improving energy consumption.
